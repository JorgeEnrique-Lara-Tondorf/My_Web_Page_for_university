    <p>
        The Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering at Universidad Francisco de Vitoria is a
        comprehensive program designed to equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary
        to excel in the field of computer engineering. The degree spans four years and covers a
        wide range of topics, from fundamental programming concepts to advanced artificial
        intelligence techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
        The curriculum is structured to provide a solid foundation in both theoretical and
        practical aspects of computer engineering. Students will engage in coursework that
        includes mathematics, programming, systems design, databases, networks, and software
        engineering, among others. The program also emphasizes the development of critical
        thinking, problem-solving abilities, and teamwork skills.
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout the degree, students will have opportunities to participate in projects,
        internships, and research activities that enhance their learning experience and prepare
        them for real-world challenges. The program culminates in an end-of-degree project,
        allowing students to apply their knowledge to a comprehensive engineering problem.
    </p>
    <p>
        Graduates of the Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering will be well-prepared for
        careers in various sectors of the technology industry or for further studies in
        specialized areas of computer science and engineering.
