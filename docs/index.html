    <h2>Welcome to my personal website</h2>

    <p>
        This website has been created as part of an academic project for the subject
        <strong>Fundamentals of Computer Engineering</strong>. My name is Jorge Enrique Lara Tondorf. The main objective of this
        site is to present the structure and content of the project in a clear and
        organized way, as well as to provide general information about my academic studies.
    </p>

    <p>
        The website is divided into several sections, each with a specific purpose.
        These sections include an overview of my degree in Computer Engineering, a detailed
        description of the subject <em>Fundamentals of Computer Engineering</em>, and a topic
        section where a subject of academic or personal interest is explained in more detail.
    </p>

    <p>
        In addition, the website contains an <strong>About Me</strong> section, which includes
        a brief personal description, my curriculum vitae, and links to my social media
        profiles. A contact section is also included, with a simple form that allows users
        to contact me. This form does not store or send any data.
    </p>

    <p>
        Overall, this website has been designed to be easy to navigate and understand,
        serving as an academic portfolio and a learning exercise in web development.
